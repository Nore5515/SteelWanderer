# SteelWanderer
An RPG around wandering a derelict aircraft carrier.

In-Depth description:
You play as a stranger, a tourist, a refugee, a thrill seeker, sailing to the Columbia, an aircraft carrier marooned on an island long ago. Tensions are on the rise as multiple powers struggle for the ship, to destroy it, to scrap it, to control it, to repair it, etc. You can choose what you will do, who to help or hurt.
You have the Silurians, a band of local tribals seeking to destroy the ship, due to it's constant pollutation of the surrounding waters. They are named the Silurians after the very insect-themed clothing and weapons.
You have the SDE, secretive, well-armed "men in black" that are intent on sapping all the information off of the carrier.

Brandon, most certainly, was not here at any point in time.
