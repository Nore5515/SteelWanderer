# SteelWanderer
An RPG around wandering a derelict aircraft carrier.

In-Depth description:
You play as a stranger, a tourist, a refugee, a thrill seeker, sailing to the Columbia, an aircraft carrier marooned on an island long ago. Tensions are on the rise as multiple powers struggle for the ship, to destroy it, to scrap it, to control it, to repair it, etc. You can choose what you will do, who to help or hurt.

You have the Silurians, a band of local tribals seeking to destroy the ship, due to it's constant pollutation of the surrounding waters. They are named the Silurians after the very insect-themed clothing and weapons.
You have the SDE, secretive, well-armed "men in black" that are intent on sapping all the information off of the carrier. Their desire for knowledge pushes them to assasinations and blackmail, making them easy targets for torture.
Then you have those who worship it, the Angels of Ferrite. They believe that the carrier was a blessing from their god of steel, and they have made it their holy crusade to repair the carrier and bring it back to their home.
Finally, you have the Iron Legion, a mercenary group dead set on gutting the ship and bringing it's belongings back with them to the north, where what they have taken is worth more per pound than gold.

And here you are, in the midst of this crossfire, seeking money, fame, refuge, freedom. You start off with only what's in your pockets, whether it be a pistol, a screwdriver, a bounty or bound in handcuffs. 

You will be able to find all sorts of loot to bring back to your boat, from scraps of steel to wires and motherboards from the ship. Exploring also risks encountering a group of others, and visiting at day has a very high chance to have your ship raided. Crafting would definetly be a thing.
